# Just A Few Icons

SVG Icons with Some Style

## Usage

 Use all the icons in sprite or as inline images. I would recommend you use these with the `<symbol>` method for SVG, defined [here](https://css-tricks.com/svg-symbol-good-choice-icons/). If you're using Gulp to build your icon sprite here's a reference.

So for example, if you wanted the reference that podcast icon in your markup you'd use this: `<use xlink:href="#jf--icon_podcast" />` and you'd be ready to go.

## Installation

Fork the repo, or download the [zip](https://github.com/charlespeters/justafewicons/zipball/master) or use Bower:
```
bower install justafewicons
```

These are [available](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gtq69sqqnfaagi7/justafewicons.sketch?dl=0) as symbols for Sketch 3

## Development

Start here are read [_SVG Icon Systems with Gulp_](http://arwhd.co/2015/05/18/svg-gulp-workflow/) from ARWHD for the methodology.

Then, fork the repo, `git clone` your fork, `npm install` in the root and run `gulp`.

### Issues
**Reduced test cases are required**. All bug reports and problem issues require a reduced test case. See [CSS Tricks - Reduced Test Cases](http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/) on why they _"are the absolute, ... number one way to troubleshoot bugs."_ Reduced test cases help you identify the issue at hand and understand your own code. On our side, they greatly reduce the amount of time spent resolving the issue.

- A reduced test case is an isolated example that demonstrates the bug or issue.
- It contains the bare minimum HTML, CSS, and JavaScript required to demonstrate the bug. No extra functionality or styling.
- A link to your site is **not** a reduced test case.
- A [JSBin](http://jsbin.com/) or [CodePen](http://codepen.io) is preferred so we can help you fix an error.
